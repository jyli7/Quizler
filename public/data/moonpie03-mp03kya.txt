Identify the following mythological figures who were torn to pieces for some reason or another, 10 points each.1. One esoteric legend about this god states that he was torn to pieces and eaten by the Titans. The more typical version, however, states that he was the God of Wine born after the death of his mother Semele, whose orgiastic rites did, however, often lead to such dismemberment for others.        Answer:	 Dionysus2. One of the victims of Dionysus's wine-maddened Maenads was this king, whose denying of the wine-god's divinity led to his own dismemberment at the hands of drunken revellers led by his mother and wife as described in Euripides's Bacchae.        Answer:	 Pentheus3.
