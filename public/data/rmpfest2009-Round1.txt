This denomination rejects the idea that the wicked dead are punished in Hell, instead holding that those not saved and resurrected by God will simply cease to exist, a fate they term the "common grave". This denomination traces its origin to the Bible Students movement led by Charles Russell. They interpret Old Testament references to "the Word" or Archangel Michael to be references to pre-incarnation Christ.

ANSWER: torii

This practice's name translates as "to grow", and it is contrasted with the similar Sadaqa, which is voluntary.

14. This work commends Turkish leaders for personally going on military expeditions and cites Bayezid II as a weak ruler able to prosper due to the work of a strong predecessor.

16. This figure is assisted by children who include Lakwa and Nibo and who are associated with the banda dance, which mimics sexual intercourse, a nod to this figure's secondary aspect as a sex deity. Apart from being assisted by the Guede spirits, this god can be honored by wearing purple and black, and he has a feast day on November 2, which coincides with the Catholic holiday of All Souls Day.

This deity first emerged from the hermitage of Katyan, a holy man for whom this deity is sometimes named. Born from the combination of multiple beams of light, this deity slew Mahishasur, a buffalo demon who could not be defeated by man or god, a trait that led the devas to create this goddess. For ten points, name this ten-armed Hindu goddess who represents the combined power of all the Hindu gods.   
ANSWER: Durga

19. An early example of the concept comes from the work of W?adys?aw Tatarkiewicz, who discussed it with reference to dominoes. Later, Vygotsky contributed to its conceptual elaboration by noting, via experiment, that children do not form classificatory concepts in the terms predicted by formal logic. And more recently, racist American anthropologist Vincent Sarich has analogized the concept to race to buttress his pernicious essentialistm. But it is Wittgenstein who made the concept famous--first by resorting to the image of a rope but more famously by discussing the trickiness of defining "games" in Philosophical Investigations. For ten points, name this term for a group of categorical items that share no universal common features and so can only be defined by reference to their overlapping similarities.
ANSWER: family resemblance

Chapter 2 of this work cites a line from Macbeth, "All is but toys: renown and grace is dead," to show how the selfish culmination of ambition leaves one grasping at grace, and thus one cannot even enjoy his own achievements. One appendix focuses on the modo ponedo form of an offense, as the affirmation of Christianity as a falsehood confers the same on Christ. Proposing that sin is a 'position' and not a 'negation,' this work begins with the elliptical definition of the self as "a relation which relates itself to its own self." It takes its title from a verse in the Gospel of John and was written under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Concluding that despair is homologous with sin, for ten points, name this "Christian Psychological Exposition" written by Soren Kierkegaard.
ANSWER: The Sickness Unto Death
