This figure's most famous lover was conceived when an almond was placed in the bosom of his mother, Nana.

Its first section decries the "vulgar materialism" which men such as Eduard Berstein have tried to disguise. This work contends that insoluble antinomies were the only thing classical philosophy could give to the bourgeois, and this work's central section consists of the essay "Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat."

TB3. Early in this work, the author distinguishes between Gluck and Gluckseligheit, though he concludes that neither can be universally valid as both rest on solely empirical principles. That discussion serves to explain the various characterizations of the "sensuous impulse" and deduces that moral law cannot contradict itself by abrogating the justifications of that impulse. In a section titled, "Deduction of Religion in General," the author requires that God produce a "complete congruency" between the moral law and the happiness of finite rational beings, asserting he must be "totally just." This work shows that a test of congruency does not hold for the doctrine of Original Sin, but it does not explicitly target Christianity.
