The Sunayev-Zeldovich distortion in the cosmic microwave background comes about as a result of the inverse form of this effect. It is the main mechanism of absorption for gamma rays in the 100 KeV to 10 MeV range and in radiation therapy, this interaction dominates over the photoelectric effect and pair production. It is target-independent, and its results can be differentiated from classical theory by observing an extra peak on the graph of wavelength versus intensity, with the difference equal to h-bar over quantity m-sub-e times c times quantity one minus cosine theta. Derivable from the conservation of momentum and energy, FTP, identify this effect that results when photons scattered off electrons undergo a shift in wavelength named for the man who received the 1927 Nobel Prize in physics for its discovery.       Answer: Compton effect3. He comes up with a plan so ingenious, it's a Swiss fucking watch.

This man eventually defeated Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge and had him executed, which coincided with his adoption of Hugh le Despenser as his new favorite. Following his victory he repealed the Ordinances, which had demanded a reduction in his power and the banishment of his then-favourite Piers Gaveston, who was executed by the opposition barons. In 1314, he lost the Battle of Bannockburn to Robert the Bruce, but it was his dependence on the Despensers which aroused the ire of his queen Isabella, who with her lover Roger Mortimer deposed this man in favor of his son in 1327.

The most important species that perform this action are the mutualistic species of Rhizobium which live in the root nodules of various legumes, and organisms which perform it are called diazotrophs.

Also known as Guthrie's problem, Arthur Cayley first addressed it in 1879, and recently, Bejamin Werner and Georges Gunthier produced a proof of it in the Coq [coke?] proof assistant.
