Places of worship in this religion are often decorated with spheres and it was once common for members of this religion to attempt to communicate with their dead ancestors, sometimes using ouija boards. The major symbol of this religion is the left eye of God, which decorates its altars and buildings.

4. W. V. O. Quine's essay "Epistemology Naturalized" contrasts Hume's language theories with those of this philosopher, who emphasized the importance of paraphrasis, or contextual definition, and translating whole sentences containing abstract terms to show the meaning of the terms without identifying corresponding objects.  In addition to that "theory of fictions", this philosopher distinguished between positive and negative acts and attacked theories of natural rights for relying on normative principles.  His first book addressed Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, and another work by this philosopher contrasts social and hedonic calculations of the aggregate and individual forms of a quantity central to his "greatest happiness principle".  FTP, name this philosopher who wrote A Fragment on Government and An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, the founder of utilitarianism.

The example of dogs fleeing when threatened with sticks is used to illustrate the definition of the soul as possessing both perception and memory, and the author criticizes the lack of a distinction between prolonged unconsciousness and absolute death in Cartesian philosophy.  The existence of God is proven a priori as a necessary truth dependent on contradiction and a posteriori as a contingent truth dependent on sufficient reason.  This work concludes by discussing the pre-existing harmony between efficient and final causes and theorizing that our world is the best of all possible worlds.  Expounding the theory that all compound substances are composed of the namesake simple ones, FTP, name this treatise by Gottfried Leibniz. 
ANSWER: The Monadology [accept: La Monadologie]

It analyzes the "Resentment of the Dead" and "The Escape of Josephus" in a section on "The Survivor" and it claims the mouth is the prototype of all prisons. This work uses the example of Cadmus' soldiers to connect the order of military formations with teeth. It describes how its first title entity is precipitated by a small group known as the "crystal", and this work's first section looks at "The Eruption" and "The Discharge" aspects of that entity. Beginning with a discussion of the fear of being touched, it claims knowledge of packs is necessary to understand social events. For 10 points, name this psychological and anthropological work of Elias Canetti. 
ANSWER: Crowds and Power or Masse und Macht

8. Pindar's fifth Pythian ode states that Excuse or Prophasis was daughter of this man and Apollonius claims that Corinth derived its original name from another of this man's children, Epyhra. This figure's nephew, the king of Phthia, married his daughter and fathered Hellen, Amphictyon and a daughter named after this man's wife. In Protagoras, Plato states this son of Clymene was responsible for naming animals and assigning them gifts. However, this son of Iapetus used up all gifts on animals and leaving humans without any special abilities. By throwing bones over her shoulder, this god's daughter, Pyrrha, helped to repopulate the earth after the flood. This figure had Pyrrha with his wife, who famously opened a pithos that fill the world with evil and disease. With a name meaning "after thought", for ten points, who is this husband of Pandora and dim-witted brother of Atlas and Prometheus?
ANSWER: Epimetheus

9. This book claimed that Noah spent 950 years "prayerfully exhorting" his people to not sin, and it uses the example of the changing of the Qibla to claim that God often destroys old habits to test faith, and it divides religious rules into groups named for things in the sky, such as the sun, moon, stars, and clouds.

ANSWER: The Book of Certitude [accept: Kitab i-Iqan]

10. In one section, this work questions the idea behind the concept of being "spread" and asks whether an object can be spread without being extended as part of an argument against the theory of a "substratum".  In another section, an example involving an insect's foot is used to criticize the distinction between primary and secondary qualities of objects, and that section concludes with the affirmation of materialism's inevitable degeneration into skepticism.  This work criticizes the equation of "real existence" with "mind-independent existence" and argues for the existence of our ideas in the mind of an infinite perceiver called God and builds on the theory set forth in the author's earlier Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge that reality is determined by our own perception.

With capital at Susa, for ten points name this ethnic group that in ancient times lived just southeast of Mesopotamia. 
ANSWER: Elamites

12. The fact that jade fragments into jadeite and nephrite, thus failing the nomicness test of projectibility is one objection to this philosophical position articulated by Jaegwon Kim, and Kim also argued that this theory forces recourse to "structure specific bridge laws" and "local reductions." One philosopher formulated this theory as a response to Ernest Nagel's "intertheoretic account", and that philosopher also used this theory to show that physicalist type identity theories are not sufficiently abstract, unlike functionalist ones. Besides Jerry Fodor, another supporter of this position used the existence of pain in a wide variety of species to show that the correspondence between mental and neural kinds posited by "brain state theory" was untenable. Developed by Hilary Putnam, for ten points, name this philosophical position arguing that a psychological kind can correspond to many possible physical kinds. 
ANSWER: Multiple Realizability

ANSWER: Peleus

14. Massimo dell'Utri's article "Choosing Conceptions of Realism" is an analysis of this concept. This concept's formulation posits a man who "has been told he understands Japanese", as well as a picture of a tree accidentally dropped by a spaceship. This concept is introduced in a chapter which begins by considering an ant tracing curves in sand such that it produces a recognizable caricature of Winston Churchill, leading into a discussion of magical theories of reference. This thought experiment compares its namesake entities with Turing machines playing the imitation game and is refuted on the basis of semantic externalism. Introduced in Reason, Truth, and History, for 10 points, name this thought experiment of Hilary Putnam, which postulates an evil scientist who connects nerve endings to a computer to produce an illusion of the real world.
ANSWER: Brains in a vat (or anything reasonably similar)
