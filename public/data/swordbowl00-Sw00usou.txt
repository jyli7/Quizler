FTP, name this group, of whom the Cumaeanone is the most famous.ANS: Sibyl(s)5) This psychiatric disorder was described in the Hindu Ayur-Veda as early as 1400 B.C., and later by the physician Soranus in the second century A.D.

Mitochondria)8) The opera house in Legnano still bears the name of the town's native son, who at age 24 was the court composer in Vienna.

FTP name this composer, whose hatred of Mozart is depicted in the play and movie Amadeus.ANS: Antonio Salieri9) CAUTION: Two answers are required. Some people get bored way too easily. Both members of this duo had graduated very early from college.

It didn't work, and the two were saved from execution only by the intervention of Clarence Darrow.

FTP, name the waterway, crucial to Iraq's access to the sea.ANS: Shatt-al-Arab11) Julian Jaynes suggests that this red-haired Greek epic hero represents the emergence of subjective consciousness during the breakdown of the bicameral mind. Perhaps so, but what we're sure of is that he fought on the Greek side during the Trojan War, displaying such a knack for deception that Dante puts him in Hell for it.

FTP, name this hero who crossed swords with Polyphemus, Circe, and Calypso, whose son was Telemachus, and whose wife was Penelope.ANS: Odysseus (acc.

FTP, name this abdominal covering membrane which often becomes infected when a swollenappendix bursts.ANS: Peritoneum16) He originally had the name of a fifteenth-century Protestant martyr, but when that man's descendants protested seeing him transformed into a fat, cowardly, drunken knight, his name was changed to the one we  know today. He's very fond of drinking, whoring, and defrauding Hostess Quickly; he's also possibly the wittiest and funniest of Shakespeare's fools. FTP, name this knight about whom Verdi wrote an opera; he is one of Prince Hal's drinking companions in I & II Henry IV, his death is reported in Henry V, and The Merry Wives of Windsor may have been written to satisfy royal demands for more of him. ANS: Sir John (Jack) Falstaff17) The first edition had a preface by Maxwell Geismar.

It wasn't until he was influenced by the Zoroastrian concept of Ahriman-the eternal principle of darkness-that he became evil, precisely speaking. But he took on the role of Adversary with much skill. FTP, name this spirit also known as Mastema, Belial, Beelzebub, and Lucifer, among others.ANS: Satan, but accept other answers w/ discretion.20) According to Homer Simpson, this President is at the party with all the others on the $10,000 bill-"passed out on the couch."

Furthermore, his encounters with UFO's and swimming rabbits suggest a bout with the DT's. FTP, name this Georgian who had careers as a Navy submarine commander and a peanut farmer and who is currently involved in a number of philanthropic and peace-oriented efforts worldwide.ANS: Jimmy Carter21) This shares its name with that of a very cheap 18th century French finance minister whose hobby was making paper shadow portraits.

If you need the name of some major exponents of that philosophy, you can still get five points.        A) 10 pts.: According to Russell's History of Western Philosophy, they maintained there could never be any rational reason for choosing one course of action over another.

It's a rather large sedan, with an amazing 18-cylinder engine (the cylinders are arranged in a "W" shape) and a 550-hp peak power.

Everything is ordinary about this vacation. That is, until they have an accident and run into the Misfit, a wanted criminal, and his gang. Maybe it would've gone better for all of them if the grandmother hadn't recognized him; at any rate, his gang kills the entire family and concludes that "'it's no real pleasure in life.'"         (ANS: "A Good Man is Hard to Find")        B) Julian doesn't like his aged mother. She casts aspersions on his life; after all, his "'great-grandfather was a former governor of this state,'" and his "'grandmother was a Godhigh.'" But he still ends up escorting her to the Y for her reducing class every Wednesday night. And it's on the bus that his mother tries to give a handout to a young African-American child.

His mother then suffers a massivestroke and dies on the sidewalk.	 (ANS: "Everything That Rises Must Converge")        C) Sheppard, a social worker and annoying do-gooder, wants to teach his son Norton how to share. So he takes into his home Johnson, a boy with a deformed foot and an attitude which combines good old Southern religion with a refined, awesome sort of evil. As Sheppard allows Johnson to take Norton's place, turning a blind eye to Johnson's blatant viciousness, Norton becomes steadily more depressed. The story ends with Norton's suicide, Johnson's arrest, and Sheppard's realization of his mistake. 	(ANS: "The Lame Shall Enter First")
7) We would be remiss if we didn't test your knowledge of Confederate generals from the War Between the States. 30-20-10, given clues, identify the general.        30 pts.: In his first taste of battle, his cavalry scattered a much larger Union force at Bowling Green, Kentucky.

While it is true that his troops gave no quarter to the captured garrison and committed some atrocities, he was not directly responsible for them. Nonetheless, his actions, particularly the fact that his troops killed many black defenders in cold blood after the surrender, did not help his reputation as a broker of race relations.        10.: Nor did his actions after the War. FTP, name the man who founded the Ku Klux Klan and reminded Mrs. Gump that "sometimes we all do things that just aren't that smart."         (ANS: Nathan Bedford Forrest)8) Given a brief description, name the following characters from Mozart's Don Giovanni for ten points each.        A) A peasant girl, betrothed to Masetto, she is seduced (albeit without much effort) by Don Giovanni.

He serves as a not very confident sidekick to the don, and avoids damnation.  (ANS: Leporello)9)	Identify the element from the clues provided on a 10-5 basis.         1a) A friend of one of my friends once reasoned that if helium makes your voice high, a heavy noble gas might make it lower. So on a dare he inhaled a great deal of this gas, more commonly used to fill lamps which produce high-intensity bursts of bluish-white light. And his voice did get lower. Unfortunately, he neglected to realize that because the gas was heavier than air, he couldn't expel all of it from his lungs. He lost consciousness and was revived by being held upside down by his friends, thus allowing the gas to escape. 	1b) The heaviest non-radioactive noble gas, its atomic number is 54(ANS: Xenon)        2a) Discovered by Arfedwedson in 1817 in the mineral petalite, when this element reacts with butyl bromide, it produces a compound used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber.	2b) The lighest metallic Group I element, its  name comes from the Greek for "stone."    (ANS: Lithium)        3a) It resembles platinum, and may be found to the right of molybdenum, below manganese, and above rhenium in the periodic table.
