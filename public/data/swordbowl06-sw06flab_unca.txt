This poem was first published in the 1819 volume of Rosalind and Helen.  It describes a "colossal wreck, boundless and bare" where "two vast and trunkless legs of stone / Stand in the desert."

FTP name these short fragments of DNA created on the lagging strand during DNA replication because DNA Polymerases can only synthesize DNA from the 5' (five prime) to 3' (three prime) end and named for a Japanese husband and wife team. 	Answer:	Okazaki fragments 7.	When a hesitant elephant asked, "You mean I'm supposed to stand on that?" he was referring to a barrel with this word written on it.  That elephant was drawn by political cartoonist Herbert Block, who originated the word on March 29, 1950.

FTP, name this author, known for his nihilistic masterpiece, Fathers and Sons.	Answer:	Ivan Turgenev10.	(UNC) Born in Leicestershire, he worked a succession of odd jobs, including time spent as a shepherd which informed his theology.  His public preaching began in 1648, and he spent much of the next several decades being persecuted and imprisoned for his beliefs, until the Act of Toleration was passed in 1689.  He believed that formal education should not be a prerequisite for the ministry, and that religious experience could be had by anyone and in any location, a theological framework that still forms the basis of the church he is considered to have founded.  FTP, identify this founder of the Society of Friends.	Answer:	George Fox11.	For one it equals s inverse while for t to the n it equals n factorial over s to the n plus one.

Derived from the Greek for "prematurely old," FTP, what is this condition which causes sufferers to mature six to eight times the rate of normal children?	Answer:	progeria (accept Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome before mentioned)17.
