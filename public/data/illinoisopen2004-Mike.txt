The fourteenth of this work's sixteen extant books gives the only reliable account of the life revolt of Boadicea, while section forty-four of book fifteen mentions the crucifixion of Jesus. While it is certain that the years 37 to 41 are missing, this work's original length is unknown, as Pliny notes only that it and the Historiae were 30 books in total length. Near its beginning, it notes the murder of Agrippa Postumus, "the new reign's first crime."

This series of reactions is accomplished by five complexes of about 1.7 MDa ["megadaltons"], the first three of which complexes function by switching the state of iron-sulfur centers and are often considered to comprise their own pathway, and only the second of which, an oxioreductase, does not change the membrane proton gradient. Walker and Boyer explained the functionality of the fifth complex in this process, ATP synthase, which is found embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and this chemiosmotic reaction results in about 34 ATP per glucose molecule processed. For ten points, name this metabolic pathway that uses the products of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, and which is named for the redox attachment of a phosphorous radical to ADP.Answer: oxidative phosphorylation (or respiratory-chain phosphorylation; do not accept or prompt on "electron transport chain" which, though a part of oxidative phosphorylation, is accomplished by only three complexes and, therefore, disqualified by the lead-in)Tossup 8.
