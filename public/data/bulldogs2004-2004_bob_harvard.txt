Yale UniversityBulldogs over Broadway--December 4, 2004Edited by Mike WehrmanPacket by HarvardTossups:1.  This architect's work is notably depicted in the School of Athens of Raphael, who bought a palace this artist designed in the Borgo district near the Vatican.  He began his career by studying painting in Urbino in Piero della Francesca's circle, and in 1490 he moved to Milan where he worked with Leonardo on such projects as the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie.  In 1499 he moved to Rome where Julius II named him chief architect of Saint Peter's Basilica, for which he designed a plan based on a Greek cross.  For ten points, identify this architect, perhaps best remembered for his chapel at the purported site of St. Peter's martyrdom, the Tempietto.Answer:  Donato Bramante2.  Its upper section is dominated by the Akosombo Dam and the huge lake it forms, from which the section known as the Mouhoun or "Black" flows.  Like the Nile, this river also has a "White" tributary, but unlike the Nile it also has a "Red" one, the latter of which splits from the "White" near the town of Du in the north of the country, flowing north parallel to the "White" into neighboring Burkina Faso.  FTP, identify this chief river of Ghana, which forms part of the old name for Burkina Faso.Answer:  Volta River3.  The comet less famously known as 109P orbits the Sun every 135 years and spends most of its time in the far reaches of the solar system.  On each pass inward, bits of dust boil from the comet's surface and when Earth passes through the debris, the bits are vaporized in the atmosphere.  These vaporizations from the comet better known as Swift-Tuttle can appear anywhere in the sky, but if traced back they will appear to emanate from a point in a certain constellation.  The result is, for ten points, this annual event, a meteor storm that occurs every August.Answer: Perseids or Perseid Meteor Shower4.  In the second chapter of this work, called "Pontius Pilate," the reader receives an eye-witness account of the hours leading up to Jesus' crucifixion as seen by "a strange professor," the devil, a.k.a. Wolond.  That character then offers Mikhail Berlioz and Ivan Ponryev a "seventh proof" of the existence of God by predicting Berlioz's decapitation.  Also featuring a vodka-quaffing cat named Behemoth, towards the end one title character sells her soul to free the other from a mental hospital.  FTP this describes what novel about Stalinist Moscow by Mikhail Bulgakov.Answer: The Master and Margarita5.  Born in Phrygia, in his early life he was sold as a slave to Epaphroditus, a powerful freedman of the emperor Nero, and came to Rome where his master allowed him to study under Marsonius Rufus, an associate of Seneca.  Though he probably wrote nothing, his pupil Arrian recorded the lecture notes of this man's school at Nicopolis into two works that survive to this day.  A famous metaphor of his compares human life to that of a dog being dragged behind a chariot, a view of freedom which aligns him with his heroes Cleanthes, Chrysippos, and Zeno.  FTP, identify this Stoic philosopher of the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, famous for his Discourses and the Enchiridion, variously translated as Manual or Handbook.Answer: Epictetus6.  After an abortive marriage with George Sand's niece and his traumatic relationship with the troubled Elisa Gros, he left Paris for the countryside where he began painting landscapes influenced by the likes of Constable and Ruisdael, such as 1844's Under the Birches, Evening.  He can be described as one of the first French environmentalists, having successfully petitioned Napoleon III to protect Fontainebleau forest.  For ten points, identify this great friend of Jean-Francois Millet, the founder of the Barbizon School.Answer: Theodore Rousseau7.  The general way to create them, devised in 1975 by Kohler and Milstein, is to mix spleen cells from a mouse that has been immunized with the desired antigen with myeloma cells, a cancerous form of B cells, resulting in a hybridoma.  Widely used as diagnostic and research reagents, they have also been introduced as medicines, such as rituximab, which binds to the CD20 molecule found on most B-cells.  For ten points, name these antibodies, all of a single specificity because they were made by a single clone of plasma cells.	Answer: Monoclonal antibodies8.  At the beginning it mentions Sosthenes, who is perhaps the man beaten by Jews angry at the author's circle in Acts 18.  It was written as a corrective to a community of early Christians whom the author had baptized; they, however, had misunderstood his teachings to the extent that they believed that there are no laws at all. Perhaps the most famous part of the letter is chapter 13, in which the writer admonishes: "So faith, hope, love, abide, these three: but the greatest of these is love" and predicts that though we now "see through a glass, darkly" when the Messiah comes we will see "face to face." FTP name this book of the New Testament, written by Paul and addressed to a Greek congregation.Answer: Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians or I Corinthians9.  Private insurance tries to keep the insured value of any misfortunate less than the value to the insured person.  However, when a person weighs the costs and benefits of an action and finds that the benefits exceed the costs, he takes action.  Thus, fire insurance encourages arson, automobile insurance encourages accidents, and disability insurance encourages dismemberment.  For ten points, name this effect, the tendency of someone insured to alter his behavior so that payment becomes more likely.Answer: Moral Hazard10.  In the fifth verse of this poem the narrator asks the title entity "Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is" and to "Be through my lips to unawaken'd earth / The trumpet of a prophecy!"  Earlier he describes that entity as "breath of Autumn's being" and that which "chariotest to their dark wintry bed / The winged seeds." Ending with "If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?" FTP this describes what poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley.Answer: Ode to the West Wind11.  The Lipschitz variety of this property requires a constant K greater than zero bounding the distance of "f of x" and "f of y" relative to x and y.  A homeomorphism has this property for itself and its inverse, and in topology, a function has this property if open sets in the range have open preimages. FTP this describes what property of functions, which is implied by differentiability but not vice versa.Answer:  Continuousness (or continuity )12.  In an attempt to strengthen its forces and as part of its appeal to "all sorts and conditions of men" its leaders sent envoys to the Allobroges, a tribe living on the outskirts of Cisalpine Gaul. But despite the persuasion of  Publius Umbrenus, the tribal leaders chose to curry favor with the Senate and communicated all it had heard to Quintus Sanga, their patron in Rome.  As a result Volturcius was arrested on the Milvian Bridge, the arrest of Lentulus soon followed, and Cato outspoke Caesar in the Senate in favor of executing the conspirators.  FTP identify this plot to overthrow the Roman Republic, recorded by Sallust and foiled by consul Cicero in 63BC.  Answer: The Catiline Conspiracy13.  The classical study of this phenomenon was performed by Jones and Harris in 1967 in which subjects listened to students reading pro- and anti-Castro speeches and assigned corresponding feelings to the readers.  When told that the readers were assigned their speeches randomly, subjects still judged pro-Castro readers to have pro-Castro feelings.  FTP this describes what psychological phenomenon in which people emphasize dispositional explanations for observed behavior instead of situational explanations.Answer:  Fundamental attribution error14.  He plays the part of a director in Day for Night, though he made his acting debut in Fool's Mate.  However he was much more famous as a critic for the Cahiers du Cinema and directing his own films, which included films on the autobiographical character Antoine Doinel.  Director of Stolen Kisses, Love on the Run, and Bed and Board, FTP names this French director famous for the movies Jules and Jim and The 400 Blows.Answer: Francois Truffaut 15.  Jonathan Franzen's New Yorker essay "Mr. Difficult" is a self-congratulatory account of reading the whole thing. Jack Green's Fire the Bastards! is a scathing indictment of the stupidity of the reviews that greeted it, for its author didn't write another novel for 20 years because of the criticism.  The narrator of David Markson's Wittgenstein's Mistress is obsessed with its author. Thomas Pynchon and Don DeLillo among others have recognized how much their ambitious novels owe to it.  For ten points, identify this encyclopedic 1955 novel by William Gaddis, the story of Wyatt Gwyon, a former seminarian who becomes a forger of Flemish masterpieces.Answer: The Recognitions16.  Like Harold II of England, this man was supposedly killed when a projectile pierced his eye, but unlike Harold, he preferred his elderly mistress, Diane de Poitiers, to his bourgeoise Florentine Queen.  Duke de Guise persuaded him to continue his father Francis I's disastrous dynastic wars.   His 1559 edict of Ecouen initiated the persecution of Protestants, which led to the 1572 St. Bartholomew's day massacre in Paris 13 years after his death. FTP, identify husband of Catherine de Medicis and King of France from 1547-1559, killed at a jousting tournament celebrating the end of the Habsburg-Valois Wars.Answer: Henry II17.  A scandal besets the town in Act I when Paca la Roseta is accused of sexual indiscretion, leading the title character ironically to call her, "The only bad woman we have in this town."  Little does she know that her own daughters, the focus of the drama, rebel more and more openly against the suffocating oppression she imposes.  Although Pepe el Romano is betrothed to the eldest daughter, Angustias, he carries on a secret affair with the youngest, Adela, who ultimately hangs herself when her mother scares Pepe off with a pistol. FTP, identify this play, perhaps an indictment of fascist, matriarchal Spain, by Federico Garcia-Lorca.Answer: La Casa de Bernarda Alba or The House of Bernarda Alba18.  Normally, if an A blood type mother has an O type child, the father is expected to be type O or at least carry the O allele.  However, in some cases, an O type child can be born to parents who do not have the O allele.  This is because the parents may be recessive for a third antigen called H that is a precursor for both A and B antigens.  For ten points, name this seemingly impossible ABO-phenotypic result, named after the Indian city where it was first described.Answer: Bombay phenotype (prompt on ABO)19.  As a student at the Tubingen seminary between 1788 and 1793 he formed friendships with Friedrich Holderlin and Friedrich Schelling.  In a rather ironic twist, it was probably the poet Holderlin who turned him from the aesthetic writings of Lessing and Schiller to the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, whom he sought to absorb and correct in massive, systematic works such as The Phenomenology of Spirit and Logic.  For ten points, identify this great German idealist philosopher, perhaps best remembered for the dialectic method later made the cornerstone of Marxist thought.Answer: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel20.  He was descended from two other secretaries of state who served in the administrations of Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, so the office was his lifelong goal.  At 30 Wilson sent him as part of the Versailles peace delegation, and he was a major figure at Dumbarton Oaks in 1945.  During his tenure as Secretary of State, he initiated the SEATO pact as well as drawing up an agreement restoring the pre-war status of Austria.  Well known for his struggles with the "tin-horn Hitler" Nasser during the Aswan crisis, FTP name this diplomat, secretary of State from 1953-59 under Dwight Eisenhower and DC airport namesake.Answer:  John Foster DullesExtras (Unedited)Since blood is not a uniform fluid, the viscosity of blood changes with velocity.  Furthermore, blood vessels are not straight, uniform pipes.  These factors make the use of this equation to describe the human circulatory system highly suspect.  For ten points, name this equation that relates the radius and length of a pipe undergoing non-pulsatile laminar flow, the viscosity of the fluid, the pressure difference, and the volume flowrate of the liquid. Poiseuille's LawNamed for a large garden that was part of an 18th century summer palace of the Bourbon kings on the River Tagus outside Madrid, it is permeated by a sense of melancholy and nostalgia for a forgotten spain.  Written in 1939, it has been performed by, among others, John Williams and Paco de Lucia.  Although written for guitar, it is perhaps best known as a piece that Miles Davis reinterpreted on his album Sketches of Spain.  For ten points, name this musical piece written by Joaquin Rodriguez.Concierto de AranjuezIn the background a scantily robed bald man looks away from the scroll he is holding open, and immediately behind him is a row of Doric columns.  From the left foreground seven angels look on at the disturbingly long-limbed infant in the lap of the title character, whose blue robe provides the greatest color contrast in the painting.  FTP name this painting depicting the Virgin Mary, the most famous work of Parmigianino.Madonna of the Long NeckThe facts in this case were strikingly similar to those in United States vs. Seeger, which preceded it by five years.  In a concurring opinion, Justice Harlan wrote that he had been convinced of his of his error in Seeger, and he noted that the case more directly concerned the Establishment Clause rather than Free Exercise, as the denial of privileges because of religious beliefs, or the lack thereof, constituted undue government endorsement of religion in general, if not any specific set of principles.  The majority opinion, delivered by Justice Black, ruled that conscientious objector status could not be denied to those not believing in a Supreme Being.  FTP, identify this 1970 case that effectively extended religious freedom to atheists.Welsh vs. United StatesPerhaps the most controversial figure in German letters at the beginning of the twentieth century, this poet began his career as a disciple of the symbolism of Mallarmé but finished it as a self-proclaimed prophet of a new aristocracy of the mind and the spirit that his detractors considered dangerously close to the irrationalism of Nazism.  For ten points, identify this poet, author of such collections as The Seventh Ring and The New Kingdom but probably best remembered for being at the center of a famous Kreis or "Circle" of writers in Weimar Germany.Stefan GEORGEIn "Semiology and Rhetoric" Paul de Man uses the ambiguity latent in the famous rhetorical question that closes this poem to demonstrate the possibility of reading it in two coherent but opposed ways.  A highly philosophical poem that deals with an old man trying considering the interrelatedness of things, the relationship between worshipper and worshipped, myth and contemporary reality, the metaphysical theories of Plato, Aristotle and Pythagoras, and, perhaps most famously, creator and creation.  For ten points, identify this Yeats poem, inspired by a visit he made to the Waterford school in 1926.AMONG SCHOOL CHILDRENYale UniversityBulldogs over Broadway--December 4, 2004Edited by Mike WehrmanPacket by HarvardBonuses:1.
