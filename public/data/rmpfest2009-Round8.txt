A 1780 public dispute between F.H Jacobi and Gotthold Lessing centered on this man's philosophy. like Hobbes this thinker adopts an amoralist stance regarding "natural right" but unlike Hobbes concludes in one work that democracy and not monarchy is the most natural form of state. In a major work he articulates a substance-monism wherein modes and attributes of that infinite substance give rise to variety and attempted to organize those arguments relating God, substance and humanity in a "Geometrical Manner."

ANSWER: Rig Veda

4. This work includes an extended analysis of the purpose and nature of architecture as a conflict between rigidity and gravity to illustrate how indistinctly originating human ideas are brought to clarity.  The author uses the analogy of magnetism and electricity as the same force to compare to the dual nature of two central concepts, and another section of this work reduces another philosopher's theory of twelve categories of understanding into the single category of causality.  This work introspectively deduces that humans perceive their bodies by means of two of the title concepts, both of which consist of the same reality and differ only due to alternate human perspectives.

Many [e.g., Matt Weiner] believe that only "Guide for the Perplexed", and not "to" or "for", should be acceptable. This tournament accepts "of the Perplexed" because the author saw a copy with that name in the Harvard library; this tournament also accepts "to the Perplexed" because Evan Nagler has assured the author that the book is referred to as that in scholarly Jewish sources)

15. One of these texts assures the reader that Christianity is not a "cunningly designed fable", using as proof the fact that God's voice was heard during the Ascension.

This author of The Conquest of Abundance wrote a work featuring a section of invective entitled "Conversations with Illiterates", which responded to critics of an earlier work. That earlier work argued Galileo's theories prevailed because he wrote rhetorically persuasive Italian and contended that Copernicanism only survived because reason was overruled. That work, which was dedicated to Imre Lakatos, also contends that the historical practice of science amounts to "anything goes", arguing for a position of "epistemological anarchism."

He argued against corporeal resurrection by comparing it to the transformation of iron into a garment. He used a fourfold structure of three maqam, one of which is split into two maslak, to present an occasionalist defense of the possibility of miracles in the seventeenth section of one work; that occasionalist position was tribute to his teacher al-Juwaynii, an Asharite. His most famous work draws on the positions of John Philoponous for its first section, which refutes doctrines of "pre-eternity" and "post-eternity" in the works of al-Farabi and Avicenna. For 10 points, name this author of Revival of the Religious Sciences and Deliverance from Error, a Sufi who also wrote The Incoherence of the Philosophers.

Apollodorus records the horrible fates suffered by this daughter of Perseis' children including Catreus, who was killed by his own son, Glaucus, who drowned in a jar of honey and Androgeus, who was killed by Aegeus for winning every prize at a feast. Either Poseidon or Aphrodite made this figure fall for her most notorious consort, who she seduced with the help of a wooden contraption covered in cow skin made by Daedalus. That seduction of the Cretan Bull led to the birth of a half-man, half-bull. For ten points, name this queen of Crete, the wife of Minos, the mother of Ariadne and the Minotaur.
ANSWER: Pasiphae

21. This thinker used the example of a classmate who claimed that he could not rightfully fail an agregation, while the titular person passed in order to show, "if the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him." A psychoanalytic presentation of a playwright who became a ward of the French State is contained in this author's Saint Genet, Actor and Martyr. Raymond Aron claimed that this thinker was attempting an impossible union of Kierkegaard and Marx in his work, Search for a Method, which would later serve as introduction to a longer work on applying that method through "dialectic circularity." In another work subtitled "An Essay Phenomenological Ontology," he outlines the in-itself and for-itself categories of being and describes the vertigo or anguish in the face of radical choice as mauvaise foi, or bad faith.
